# Handwritten_Character_Recognition

Handwritten text recognition(HTR) often referred to as "Handwriting Recognition" (HWR), refers to a computer's ability to recognise and process understandable handwritten data from sources such as paper documents, photos, touch-screens, and other devices. The formatting, accurate character segmentation, and word-finding processes are all handled by a handwriting recognition system.

## Important stages in a HTR model

### Image processing 
 This plays a vital role in handwritten text recognition by enabling the extraction of meaningful information from handwritten documents. The process typically begins by capturing an image of the handwritten text, which may contain variations in writing styles, sizes, and orientations. Image processing techniques are then employed to enhance the quality of the captured image, such as reducing noise, enhancing contrast, and removing unwanted artifacts. 

### Segmentation
Once the image has been pre-processed, it undergoes various stages of analysis, where image processing algorithms are applied to extract relevant features from the text. These algorithms can detect and segment individual characters or words, employing techniques like edge detection, binarization, and contour analysis. By isolating the text elements, the handwritten characters can be identified and separated for further analysis.

### Feature Extraction
Feature extraction is a crucial step in handwritten text recognition, as it helps in representing the unique characteristics of each handwritten character or word. Various techniques, such as histogram-based methods or structural analysis, can be employed to extract these features. These features serve as inputs to machine learning algorithms or pattern recognition models, allowing them to learn and recognize different handwritten text patterns.

### Post-Processing
Finally, the recognized text can be post-processed to refine the results, such as correcting errors or improving the overall accuracy. This post-processing stage may involve additional image processing techniques, like optical character recognition (OCR) or natural language processing (NLP), to interpret the recognized text and provide a more meaningful output.

## Process
Handwritten text recognition relies on image processing techniques to preprocess and analyze images of handwritten text. Image processing plays a crucial role in extracting meaningful information from the images and preparing them for recognition. Initially, the handwritten text images are loaded and converted to grayscale to simplify the analysis. Various image processing operations are then applied, such as resizing the images to a standardized format, adjusting their aspect ratio, enhancing contrast, and normalizing pixel values. These operations help in standardizing the appearance and quality of the images, making them more suitable for further analysis.

Once the images are processed, the text recognition system can apply machine learning or deep learning algorithms to extract features and recognize the individual characters or words. The processed images serve as input to these algorithms, which learn patterns and characteristics to identify and classify the handwritten text accurately. Image processing techniques ensure that the images are in a consistent format, facilitating more reliable and efficient recognition.

Overall, image processing is a vital step in the handwritten text recognition pipeline as it enables the system to transform raw images of handwritten text into a standardized and optimized format for subsequent analysis and recognition. By enhancing the quality and consistency of the images, image processing contributes to improving the accuracy and performance of the handwritten text recognition system.

## Dataset
The Kaggle dataset provides us with the IAM (IAM Handwriting Database) is a widely used and publicly available dataset that has significantly contributed to the development and evaluation of handwritten text recognition systems. The IAM Database consists of a large collection of forms, letters, and documents written by different individuals. It includes over 1,000 pages of handwritten text, containing approximately 115,000 isolated and labelled words.

The words have been extracted from pages of scanned text using an automatic segmentation scheme. All form, line and word images are provided as PNG files and the corresponding form label files, including segmentation information and variety of estimated parameters from the preprocessing steps described in are included in the image files.
In this project we leveraged the IAM word dataset to train, validate, and test our handwritten text recognition model. By utilizing this dataset, we tackled the challenges associated with handwritten text, such as variability in handwriting styles, different character shapes, and varying line slant or skew.
